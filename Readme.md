> The Readme file is under construction. It is estimated that the readme will be finished due to 1 a.m. 30 November 2019. <p style="color: red"> Due to the current climate disorders that have encountered in Tehran, the deadline of the completion has been postponed to tomorrow. Thanks for your patience. <h2 style="color:green">Special thanks to Amir Rostami for his patience and collaboration</h2> </p>

In this project evolutionary algorithm with various methods e.g. mutation cross-over have been implemented. The list of the algorithms that are implemented as reported as below:

### Cross over methods
- [x] default cross over
- [x] multi point cross over
- [ ] other ideas

### Mutation methods
- [x] default method
- [x] swap mutation
- [ ] other ideas

# Todo list:
- [ ] The whole idea behind evolutionary algorithm will be explained
- [ ] General structure of the main code will be explained
- [ ] Consequently the prototype of the methods will be discussed and a short description for the given methods
- [ ] The summary of the implemented methods will be added to the end
- [ ] Any other useful changes are appreciated.

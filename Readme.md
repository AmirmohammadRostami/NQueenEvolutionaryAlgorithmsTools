In this project evolutionary algorithm with various methods e.g. mutation cross-over have been implemented. The list of the algorithms that are implemented as reported as below:

### Cross over methods
- [x] default cross over
- [x] multi point cross over
- [ ] other ideas

### Mutation methods
- [x] default method
- [x] swap mutation
- [ ] other ideas


# Todo list:
- [ ] The whole idea behind evolutionary algorithm will be explained
- [ ] General structure of the main code will be explained
- [ ] Consequently the prototype of the methods will be discussed and a short description for the given methods
- [ ] The summary of the implemented methods will be added to the end
- [ ] Any other useful changes are appreciated.
